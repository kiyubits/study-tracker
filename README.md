a simple study tracker in python that makes the terminal show a screen to indicate a session is in progress.

# How To Run

you just need to run it like any python file, and i don't think extra packages are needed

```python3 study-tracker.py``` (or equivalent)

press `enter` after entering a session to end it.

json data is appended to `study_sessions.json` automatically. you may want to change the initial starting date to make the day number valid for when you started your grind :)
